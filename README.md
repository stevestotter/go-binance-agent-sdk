# Go Binance Trader

Using [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) feeds of cryptocurrency markets to instruct algorithmic traders (agents).

The first aim is to implement work done in my old Master's thesis and [published research](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-44994-3_2) on a real market to how effective these agents are in real life.

The following aims are to:
- Provide the community with a framework (or tools) in order to build their own agents and take advantage of algorithmic trading
- Experiment with bespoke agents and ideas
- See if it can make any money!


**Please Note:** This is still at a very early stage so code structure, interfaces and even the name of this repository are likely to change.
